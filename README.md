## Purpose

**KlodWorld** is the game server â€” it powers the actual gameplay. Players interact with it in real-time, and Game Masters use it to configure and manage game worlds.

Each world is independent and can have its own rules, defined via a Game Master interface. The server handles:
- Procedural map generation (biomes, terrain, hex wrapping, etc.)
- Empire and city management
- Logistics, economy, units, and combat
- Turn synchronization every 5 minutes
- Divine missions and AI systems
- Persistent world state and save/load

It is designed to support both:
- Free demo worlds (reset monthly)
- Premium persistent worlds
